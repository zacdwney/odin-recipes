    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Easy Mushroom Pasta comes together in minutes. Spaghetti is coated in a simple sauce made from seasoned sautéed mushrooms and parmesan cheese.</p>
  
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces Spaghetti</li>
        <li>4 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>16 ounces white mushrooms sliced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves minced</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta according to its package directions. Before draining the pasta, reserve one cup of the starchy cooking water.</li>
        <li>As the pasta cooks, make the mushroom sauce. Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the butter and olive oil. Once the butter is melted, add the mushrooms. Cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the onions to the skillet. Cook for five minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and the mushrooms are dark.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, salt, time, and pepper. Cook for two minutes, stirring often.</li>
        <li>Remove the skillet from the heat. Slowly and carefully add ¼ cup of the reserved water. Stir and scrape up any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add the mushrooms and the Parmesan cheese to the cooked and drained pasta. Stir well.</li>
        <li>If the pasta looks a little dry, add more cooking water.</li>
     </ol>
